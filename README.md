# Adopt-A-Pal

The following is a dynamic PHP website where a user can adopt a dog or a cat. 
They can browse through healthcare guides, search for pets to adopt and create 
their own account, which will allow them to Give Away their own pet. 
Their are 8 main tabs; 
'Home', 'Cat care', 'Dog Care', 'Find A Pet', 
'Have a pet to give away', 'Login', 'Logout' 
and 'Contact us' 

Using XAMPP LocalHost, running the code directly 
from your local server will allow you to access the site. 

A non-functional version of the website was made using 
000webhost.com , as well as the Github Pages version here.
