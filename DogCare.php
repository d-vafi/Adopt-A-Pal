	<p> Feeding </p>
	<p> 
	<ul > 
		<li> Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day. </li>
		<li> Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day. </li> 
		<li> Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day. </li> 
		<li> When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough. </li> 
		<li> For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals. </li> 
	</ul>
	
	<p>"Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be mixed with water, broth or canned food. 
	Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg or fruits and vegetables, 
	but these additions should not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake.
	</p>
	
	<p>Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for large breeds). 
	Please limit "people food," however, because it can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth problems 
	and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity. 
	Clean, fresh water should be available at all times, and be sure to wash food and water dishes frequently."

	<p> Grooming </p>
	
	<p> 
		"We recommend brushing at least 1-3 times a week and bathing at least every 1-2 months. 
		Any grooming should mostly be light trims around the face, ears, paws, and sanitary areas every 4-6 weeks. 
		Typically, wire-haired dogs should not be shaved down as their coat may grow back softer and a different color." <br>

	<p> Remember: Pet Care starts with a caring owner! The more love you give your pet, the healthier it will be. It's important to take time out of your day 
		to properly train, discipline and play with your pet. We recommend an hour a day of playtime, walking, and training everyday. This way, your pet is guaranteed proper care!
