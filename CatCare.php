	<p> Feeding </p>
	
	"We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food. 
	Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and determine the best diet. 
	Factors such as age, activity level and health make a difference in what and how much a cat should eat."
	
	<p> 
	<ul > 
		<li>  Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. 
		The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.</li>
		<li> You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your catâ€™s water bowls daily.</li>
		<li> Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet. </li>
		<li> Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well  Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned. </li>
		<li> Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two days. </li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p>Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for large breeds). 
	Please limit "people food," however, because it can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth problems 
	and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity. 
	Clean, fresh water should be available at all times, and be sure to wash food and water dishes frequently."

	<p> Grooming </p>
	
	<p> 
	"In general, cats should be given a bath once every 4-6 weeks, depending on how often they groom themselves, and the environment they're usually in. 
	If your cat is more outdoorsy and soils itself while playing, it's a good idea to help with the grooming process as they alone won't be able to properly get cleaned. " <br>

	<p> Remember: Pet Care starts with a caring owner! The more love you give your pet, the healthier it will be. It's important to take time out of your day 
		to properly train, discipline and play with your pet. We recommend an hour a day of playtime, walking, and training everyday. This way, your pet is guaranteed proper care!
